# EasySslStream
Library for client/Server ssl connections.
Uses .Net's SslStream for ssl connections, and openssl for generating certificates.

Main functionality is to handle sending text messages, sending files, directiories, byte buffers, without forcing user to handle Streams

It's also an api to Openssl, giving you possibility to generate certificates for SslStream programatically,


The project itself is my way to learn .net and it evolves in proportion to my knowledge.
It also serves me as a tool in IT administrator work.
